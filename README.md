# Algo-Robots-FX
A compilation of trading robots used to trade the Foreign Exchange Market. All programmed in MQL4

Hello!

I've been trading Forex for about 3 years now and after realizing how stressful live can be I decided to go automated to relieve the stress.

I hope you enjoy and learn from my code!

The Cristos System revolves around opening trade right before market open to catch volatile movements. Backtested from Jan 2013 to August 2019 the system was able to return 55% in profits with minimal drawdown (10%). This is at USD 5000 starting capital at 0.04 lots.

Note: This is backtested data and have not yet gone live. Therefore, I have no way of proving of this robot will indeed perform well going forward.
