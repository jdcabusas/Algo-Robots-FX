# Algo-Robots-FX
A compilation of trading robots used to trade the Foreign Exchange Market. All programmed in MQL4

Hello!

I've been trading Forex for about 3 years now and after realizing how stressful live can be I decided to go automated to relieve the stress.

I hope you enjoy and learn from my code!

Cristos Robot

Revovles around trading dring the opening of a market or befor news event. Times can be adjusted.

Mover Robot

Using MA crossovers to open trades and ride trends. Uses moving average as trailing stop.

SideStand Robot
I am currently live testing this robot. Simply open trades on five currency pairs on their 5M chart using MA cross. Using only 0.01 lot to capture small gains and then discretionary trade also. Looking only for a semi automatic trading approach.
